Thank you for trying Jupidator.

This bundle contains both, the Jupidator library, and the source code.
To use this library, only the file "jupidator.jar", found under
"dist" is needed.

Just include it in the class path of your application and you can use it.
This jar is also self-executed. You can use it from the command line
just the way you could use it as a bundled library.
To use it, you can type:
java -jar jupidator.jar

Have a look then at the required parameters.



Documentation files can be found under dist/doc directory.

To compile the library from sources, use the following ant task:
ant jar

To make documentation, use the following ant task:
ant doc
You might need docbook utilities and dtddoc to create documentation.

Thank you for being interested with Jupidator, the java-based auto-update library
