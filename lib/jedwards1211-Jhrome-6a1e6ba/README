____/ Getting Started \____________________________________________________

To get started, run org.sexydock.tabs.demos.SexyTabsDemos.  The program
displays source code for various examples and allows you to launch them.
This source code should be a good first introduction.  If you have other
questions, check the Javadocs in org.sexydock.tabs.TabbedPane, or send me
an e-mail.

____/ Status \_____________________________________________________________

This project is currently in beta stage.  It works very well, but there are
no automated tests, it needs more documentation, and it needs more polish
in areas like look and feel workflow and allowing access to tab DnD state.

I'm going ahead and releasing it because I'm quite busy at the moment, and
if I wait until it's polished enough for a first release, well, I'll never
get around to it.  On the other hand, if I do release it now, I'll probably
be more motivated to polish it up in the future.

The root package is org.sexydock.tabs because I may make an entire docking
framework based around this, if I feel like it.  If so, that framework will
be called SexyDock, and this project will be called SexyTabs, or 
SexyDock.Tabs, or whatever. In the package scheme, Jhrome refers 
specifically to the Google Chrome look in the org.sexydock.jhrome package.  
I'm releasing this project as "Jhrome" because I think the name will catch 
on better.
